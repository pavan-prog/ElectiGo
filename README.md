# ElectiGo

**ElectiGo** is an online-based election management system where **Super Admin**, **Sub Admin**, and **Voters** interact within a role-based access control scheme. The application allows Super Admins to create and manage elections, Sub Admins to oversee the elections and candidates, and Voters to securely cast their votes after authorization.

Architecture

The project follows the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller) with a clear separation of concerns. It is organized into the following layers:

    Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses, directing them to the appropriate service methods.

    Service Layer: Contains business logic and service methods that are called by the controller.

    Repository Layer: Manages database operations, handling interactions with the data layer using Spring Data JPA or MongoDB.
